# Skinpack Creator for Minecraft Bedrock

> I created this, since after you upload your own skins they will loose their "slim" property and using Skins from skinpacks dodges that.
> Now sadly it is a bit of a hassle to create such a skinpack from scratch

Workaround idea from this Bugtracker [Post](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186591)

### How to use:
1. Download the .exe File located in the "dist" Folder.
2. Open it.
3. Do what it asks you to.

4. Pretty simple right?
